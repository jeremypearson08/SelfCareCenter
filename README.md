The learning goal was to become more comfortable with the concepts that we've already covered in Mod 1. To complete the project I worked with CSS, HTML, and Javascript.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
The wins were becoming more confident with creating an app from scratch, and becoming more comfortable with CSS and HTML. The challange that took the longest was getting the mastering the hidden functionality. I was able to overcome it but rewritting certain areas of code.
